Mild reading difficulties are a pervasive symptom of aphasia, a language impairment common post stroke. In this study, we used eye tracking to investigate sentence reading by one person diagnosed with aphasia (PWA), compared to a neurologically healthy participant (NHI). Data were extracted from a larger project on sentence reading (published in Aphasiology online). The main aim of this study was to find out whether the eye movements of these two readers are influenced by linguistic factors of word frequency and contextual predictability. The two participants read sentences including target words that varied in word frequency and contextual predictability, and answered comprehension questions. We recorded gaze duration, total fixation duration, and first-pass regressions. Results demonstrated that the PWA had prolonged gaze and total fixation duratations and an increase of first-pass regressions compared to the NHI. Both readers were influenced by word frequency and predictability, but in different ways. Readers varied in gaze duration and first-pass regressions in particular, which may point to differences in the phase of lexical access.
